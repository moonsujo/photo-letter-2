i don't completely understand everything i'm taking from dammafra's project.
if i simplified the feature, i would never have read someone else's code.
same goes for writing a video puzzle instead of photo puzzle.
i wish i was smart enough to learn all of these things at once.

parts of dammafra's card
chunking
canceling, sequence
writing font as points
camera control
code organization
typescript

i enjoyed reading dammafra's code
i don't enjoy copying code and debugging it. i don't understand what went wrong. i don't like relying on AI to debug.
i was hooked by the handwriting feature. i didn't think about how it was going to be incorporated into my idea.
